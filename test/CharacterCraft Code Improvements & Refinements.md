# CharacterCraft Code Improvements & Refinements

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. Data Structure Limitations
- Characters lack detailed bio storage
- No trait assignment system for saved characters
- Limited export functionality
- No modular bio editing capabilities

### 2. Character Comparison Weaknesses
- Basic comparison logic
- Limited narrative depth
- No detailed writing prompt generation
- Poor export formatting

### 3. Bio Generation Issues
- Static template-based generation
- No autobiography feature
- Limited personalization
- No section-based editing

### 4. User Experience Problems
- No trait assignment interface
- Limited character management
- Basic export options
- No detailed character reports

## Proposed Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Data Structure
```javascript
// New Character Object Structure
{
  id: timestamp,
  basicInfo: {
    name: string,
    age: number,
    gender: string,
    locale: string,
    occupation: string
  },
  traits: {
    physical: [],
    psychological: [],
    background: [],
    motivations: [],
    custom: []
  },
  bios: {
    external: string,      // Current bio (world's view)
    autobiography: string, // New first-person narrative
    sections: {
      childhood: string,
      education: string,
      career: string,
      relationships: string,
      struggles: string,
      passions: string
    }
  },
  metadata: {
    created: timestamp,
    lastModified: timestamp,
    version: number
  }
}
```

### 2. Modular Bio System
- **Section-based generation**: Each bio aspect (childhood, career, etc.) generated separately
- **Editable sections**: Users can modify specific parts without regenerating entire bio
- **Template variations**: Multiple templates per section for variety
- **Consistency checking**: Ensure sections align with character traits

### 3. Advanced Trait Assignment
- **Visual trait selector**: Bubble interface for easy trait assignment
- **Category filtering**: Filter traits by type (physical, psychological, etc.)
- **Trait relationships**: Some traits influence others
- **Custom trait creation**: Users can add personalized traits

### 4. Enhanced Character Comparison
- **Detailed analysis**: Compare personalities, backgrounds, motivations
- **Conflict identification**: Highlight potential sources of tension
- **Collaboration potential**: Identify areas of synergy
- **Writing prompt generation**: Create detailed scenario prompts
- **Export options**: Multiple formats (HTML, PDF, plain text)

### 5. Autobiography Feature
- **First-person narrative**: Internal perspective vs external bio
- **Age-appropriate voice**: Writing style matches character age
- **Personal struggles**: Hidden challenges and internal conflicts
- **Secret passions**: Unrevealed interests and dreams
- **Life milestones**: Key formative experiences

### 6. Export System Overhaul
- **Multiple formats**: HTML, PDF, plain text, JSON
- **Detailed reports**: Complete character dossiers
- **Writing prompts**: Formatted scenario documents
- **Character sheets**: RPG-style stat sheets
- **Comparison reports**: Side-by-side character analysis
