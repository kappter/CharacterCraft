# CharacterCraft

## Overview
CharacterCraft is a web-based tool designed to inspire writers by generating unique character profiles and autobiographical narratives for creative writing prompts. The app randomizes names, ages, genders, locales, occupations, and traits to create fresh bios, with an optional "Autobiography" feature adding a first-person perspective on personal struggles and passions.

## Features
- **Create Tab**: Generate random character bios with "Randomize All" and individual field randomization.
- **Autobiography**: Adds a first-person narrative and bio preview, reflecting life experiences based on age.
- **Compare Tab**: Compare saved characters (to be implemented).
- **Traits Tab**: Display and manage trait lists.
- **Saved Tab**: Store and update character profiles.
- **Trait Bubbles**: Visualize traits by category.
- **Dark Mode**: Toggleable theme for user preference.
