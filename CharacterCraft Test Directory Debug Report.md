# CharacterCraft Test Directory Debug Report

## URL Investigated
https://kappter.github.io/CharacterCraft/test/index.html

## Issues Identified

### 1. 404 Resource Loading Errors
- Multiple "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404" errors
- This indicates missing files that the HTML is trying to load

### 2. Using Original Version
- The test directory appears to be using the original CharacterCraft, not the enhanced version
- Missing enhanced features:
  - No fixed header/footer layout
  - No "Generate Autobiography" button
  - Basic styling instead of enhanced CSS
  - Simplified navigation tabs

### 3. Console Warnings
- "Character select element not found, skipping this select" warnings
- Suggests JavaScript is looking for elements that don't exist

### 4. Layout Issues
- No fixed header/footer as implemented in enhanced version
- Basic styling suggests enhanced_styles.css is not being loaded
- Navigation appears to be original version

## Root Cause Analysis
The test directory likely contains:
1. Original index.html instead of enhanced_index.html
2. Missing enhanced JavaScript files (autobiography_generator.js, character_manager.js, etc.)
3. Missing enhanced_styles.css
4. Possibly incorrect file references in HTML

## Next Steps
1. Check what files are actually in the test directory
2. Identify which enhanced files are missing
3. Create corrected versions with proper file references
4. Provide deployment instructions
